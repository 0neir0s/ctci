Infinite loops in a web crawler

What does it mean to visit a page ?
Content or URL - Both are not enough alone. Estimation of similarity based on both would be better. 

Solution:
Should have a datavase which stores a list of items we need to crawl.

Query the database to see whether anything similar can be crawled recentlyIf it is, it will be added to the database with low priority.
If not, crawl the page and insert its links into the database

Completion:
Set a mininum priority that a page must have to be crawled.
