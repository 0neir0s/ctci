Question:
Design data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or Linkedin. Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the connection b/w 2 people

Assume no limits:
DFS is highly wasteful. BFS is better people who are connected tend to be within 2 or 3 levels.

Get real:
Too many people. So, will have to split groups across machines.
Map each friend to an id which will be stored as connections. 
How to split groups ?
Hoe to mark nodes as visited ?

Solve:
Smart segregation - by country, state etc.
Batch lookups - do it together for 100s of people in the same machine
Have a separate hash table since marking node will mess up multiple searches.
